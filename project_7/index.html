                <p>The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well suited to all
                communal living spaces and bedrooms. Consisting of a series of arranged, powder 
                coated rectangular and circular shapes, Meta’s appearance changes from delicate and
                thin, to substantial and full depending on the viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional 
                storage for your reading material and an even top for decorative accessories.</p>

                <p>Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and construction,
                as well as the visual lightness, form the aesthetic characteristics of the shelf.
                Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel, a girder and shelves, the system functions
                similar to a construction kit. Only four screws fix the girder together to which
                the shelves are simply hung up without any tools. The material and precision of
                the components guarantee the stability and assembly.</p>

                <p>
                Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf
                is open to diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside or side table,
                bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine collection, serving as a compact
                standing desk, or safeguarding small personal essentials as a hallway tray.
                The Float Shelf equally adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique accommodation
                and boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most elegant degree, the strict geometry of
                this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of two
                offset levels cut from a single sheet of aluminum, with a simple two-fold composition allowing
                for flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the reduced aesthetic principles of
                modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the essence of a shelf.
